Great question! The first step in taking the plunge is to acquire a domain name. A domain name wikipedia.org, amazon.com, or hammack.dev is your ticket-to-ride in exposing your presence to the public internet and are configured through the backbone of the internet - the domain name system. DNS records can be thought of as the internet\u0026rsquo;s phonebook, and by acquiring a domain you are adding your presence to the world.\nWhere do I get a domain name? You have options:\nI\u0026rsquo;m just looking for some casual non-committal fun: You can use a free service such as DuckDNS or NoIP that can provide you with your own custom domain name. The limitation of these websites is that you are acquiring a subdomain and have limited configuration of your DNS records.\nI\u0026rsquo;m looking for something serious and long-term: Purchase a domain name from a registrar, such as Google Domains, Namecheap, or CloudFlare\nFor my domain name management, I use CloudFlare. Keep reading to find out why!\nWhat do I do with my domain name? Your next step is to create or configure an A-record that resolves to your server\u0026rsquo;s IP address. How this is done depends on your previous option above.\n If you\u0026rsquo;re using a free subdomain service like DuckDNS or NoIP, they may have provided you with a secret token. Calling their refresh API will automatically publish your IP address as the A-record. If you purchased your domain name from a registrar, most have a tool to guide you through the process of creating records.  Can I see your configuration as a reference? Sure! As mentioned previousily, my domain name is managed through Cloudflare. This is what my DNS dashboard looks like. In the screenshot above, I had two DNS records.\n A CNAME record. This record defers resolution of hammack.dev to bhammack.github.io. This is the website you are currently viewing! An A record. This record is a Wildcard DNS record. In effect, this means any resolution of a subdomain of hammack.dev such as jenkins.hammack.dev or photos.hammack.dev will resolve to the IP address listed. This configuration is critical for hosting of multiple services.  Why Wildcard DNS records? Why not fixed A records? Because I only expose one IP address to the internet, I elected to use a wildcard DNS record. Alternatively, I could specify subdomain A-records for each of my services but this would become difficult to scale and manage. The downside of using a wildcard record is that Cloudflare cannot proxy or cache traffic destined for subdomains.\n","permalink":"https://hammack.dev/posts/homeserver/dns/","summary":"How do I begin?
