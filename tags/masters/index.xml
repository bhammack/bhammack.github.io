      <description>Why get a Masters at OMSCS?  OMSCS is really affordable. I wanted a Masters of computer science. OMSCS is online.  Courses Below are the eight courses I took as part of the OMSCS program. Due to completing prior graduate level coursework at another university, I was able to transfer over six credits worth of work towards my degree.
CS6035 Intro to Information Security ★★★☆☆
 Intro to Info Sec (IIS) is recommended as the best &amp;ldquo;starter&amp;rdquo; course in the OMSCS program in order to prepare new applicants for the level of rigour required to succeed in the program.</description>
