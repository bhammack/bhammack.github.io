      <description>My father recently has been looking to migrate his existing IP camera patchworked-system into Home Assistant as a central viewing location for all IoT devices.

      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content.

We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>
