      <description>Ingredients 1 - 1&amp;amp;1/4 &amp;quot; thick. Weighted pan, set heat to 7 (HIGH). Pan may smoke before steak is on, that is ok.
Steps  Season steak in S&amp;amp;P (and probably butter beforehand). Butter will burn in pan if thrown in, so don&amp;rsquo;t. Place in pan. Not too much splattering. For medium/med-rare, cook 4-5 minutes per side. Noteworthy, when blood begins to seep out the top of the steak, it is getting close to done.</description>
