Hey there!

I'm a software engineer specializing in software integrations. I employ novel solutions and best practices in all the code-bases I touch, crafting code not only for the customer, but also for my fellow engineers.

## Experience

**Systems Development Engineer** - Amazon Web Services

**Software Engineer** - Lockheed Martin

## What are my tools of the trade?

I am a full stack web developer with intricate experience in software integration and operations support. My tool belt consists of:
* **Python**: Pandas, Flask
* **JavaScript**: both back-end and front-end
  * NodeJS: Express, Nuxt
  * VueJS & React, Leaflet
* **Docker**: Containerization of existing applications and design around the 12-factor application model.

I am familiar with designing and operating both relational (MySQL, sqlite3) and non-relational (mongodb, embedded datastores) databases.

**Masters of Science**: Computer Science, specialization in Interactive Intelligence

**Bachelors of Science**: Computer Science
