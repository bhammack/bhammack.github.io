<li>I wanted a Masters of computer science.</li>
<li>OMSCS is online.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="courses">Courses</h2>
<p>Below are the eight courses I took as part of the OMSCS program. Due to completing prior graduate level coursework at another university, I was able to transfer over six credits worth of work towards my degree.</p>
<h3 id="cs6035-intro-to-information-security">CS6035 Intro to Information Security</h3>
<p><code>★★★☆☆</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Intro to Info Sec (IIS) is recommended as the best &ldquo;starter&rdquo; course in the OMSCS program in order to prepare new applicants for the level of rigour required to succeed in the program. So naturally this was the last class that I took before graduating :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>IIS was very broad intro course, covering multiple info-sec related topics ranging from buffer-overflow attacks to general web-security principles.</p>
<h3 id="cs6250-computer-networking">CS6250 Computer Networking</h3>
<p><code>★★★☆☆</code></p>
<kbd>★★★☆☆ not great</kbd> 

<p>CN</p>
<h3 id="cs6300-software-development-process">CS6300 Software Development Process</h3>
<p><code>★★☆☆☆</code></p>
<p>I honestly don&rsquo;t recall much about this course other than it being very easy. It&rsquo;s another learn-about-and-simulate-scrum-in-a-group-project kind of class; no different than my undergraduate level. If you come from a software development background or are already familar with topics like version control, agile/scrum, and containerization this class will be boring.</p>
<p>Though it can be an excuse to use your side-project as a means of getting course credit.</p>
<h3 id="cs6440-intro-to-health-informatics">CS6440 Intro to Health Informatics</h3>
<p><code>★★★★☆</code></p>
<h3 id="cs6750-human-computer-interaction">CS6750 Human-Computer Interaction</h3>
<p><code>★★★★★</code></p>
<p>Great course in design theory and how humans subconsciousily interact with interfaces. My notes on this course have since influenced every single UI design that I&rsquo;ve worked on. Much of the course content overlaps with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Everyday_Things">Don Norman&rsquo;s Design of Everyday Things</a>, which is an enlightening book itself.</p>
<h3 id="cs7637-knowledge-based-ai">CS7637 Knowledge-Based AI</h3>
<p><code>★★★★☆</code></p>
<p>Really more of a philosophy of AI course. There&rsquo;s not much computer science here, more of &ldquo;how we would make the ideal artificially intelligent agent if computing wasn&rsquo;t part of the equation.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="cs7641-machine-learning">CS7641 Machine Learning</h3>
<p><code>★★★★★</code>
Really hard, really good.</p>
<p>Biggest gripe: The grading schema. The feedback loop of providing students with a grade of how well they&rsquo;re doing in the course is broken. You may get a 40/100 on an assignment, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re in danger of failing. My grades on papers ranged from 100% to 30%, and I ultimately ended up with an A in the course. It may have been Isbel&rsquo;s intent to mask grades as to make students focus on the content instead of the grade. If it was, it sure worked.</p>
<h3 id="cs7646-machine-learning-for-trading">CS7646 Machine Learning For Trading</h3>
<p><code>★★★★☆</code>
Not very difficult if you have prior experience with machine learning. Some of the projects involved creating machine learning models from scratch, which I found to be an excellent exercise that CS7641 did not offer.</p>
<p>However, my major grip with the course is that the content ends with one application of machine learning to trading. All the coursework was building up to synthesizing the machine learning material with the trading material. I would love to see how this course could be taught if CS7641 was made a prerequisite, and thus a significant amount of course content wasn&rsquo;t spent on re-learning supervised learning concepts.</p>
